% inpsubspaces provides inner products of each base of each subspaces
% 
% inp = inpsubspaces(SS, X)
%
%
%Output parameter:
% inp: the inner products, where size(inp,1) is the number of data, size(inp,2) is the dimension of the subspaces, and size(inp,3) is the number of the subspaces
%
%Input parameters:
% SS: subspaces, where size(SS,1) is the dimension of the subspaces, size(SS,2) is the dimension of the data and size(SS,3) is the number of the clusters
% X: data, where the number of data is size(X,1) and the dimension of the data is size(X,2)
