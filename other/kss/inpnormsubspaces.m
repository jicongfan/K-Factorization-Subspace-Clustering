% inpnormsubspaces provides the norm of inner products in each subspaces
% 
% inpnorm = inpnormsubspaces(SS,X)
%
%
%Output parameter:
% inpnorm: the norm in projected subspacess
%
%Input parameters:
% SS: subspaces, where size(SS,1) is the dimension of the subspaces, size(SS,2) is the dimension of the data and size(SS,3) is the number of the clusters
% X: data, where the number of data is size(X,1) and the dimension of the data is size(X,2)
